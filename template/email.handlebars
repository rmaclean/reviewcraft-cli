Hi {{{firstName}}},

Firstly, thank you for submitting your proposal for DevConf 2025 and let me apologise for taking so long to respond. We’ve received ‘decline’ mails on many occasions, so please know that we get it, and hope this feedback offers perspective and gets you closer to your next ‘accept’. Our process is documented here https://www.devconf.co.za/selection it’s worth a read to put this feedback into context, but also so we don’t flood you with info in this mail.

Just a note, that I am using a template to help write this feedback - there are so many requests that it does speed it up. Please know that regardless of this template, I am reading everything in your submission and making sure you get personal content from me below. Candice may also respond if she thinks I omitted anything or got anything wrong.

About "Does not fit" flags: These were selected by reviewers when they felt the session would not fit at the event, had a major issue in the description or somehow would not do well in the reviews. It was up to the reviewer how they chose to use them. For example, one reviewer used this on every talk which ignored the request for anonymity. There were no talks that got this flag from everyone, and this reflects realistically the benefits of a diverse set of reviewers who had different views and it is the collective wisdom that built the agenda. Almost a third of selected talks had this flag, so it is possible to be selected with this. It is best to see these as you did not fit with a reviewer or two, not that you did something wrong.

About "Diamond" flags: These were selected by reviewers when they thought the session should absolutely be in the event - it is a top session. As with "Does not fit", no single talk got universal acclaim.

We sincerely appreciate the effort and thought that goes into submitting and hope you’ll continue working towards presenting at community events. Our organisation also runs monthly meet-ups, some of which are hosted online. We invite you to visit www.developerug.org.za to learn more or request to speak. Online events allow for both local and international speakers, so please indicate your location if you’re interested in presenting.
